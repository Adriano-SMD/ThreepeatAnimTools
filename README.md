# Threepeat Anim Tools

This repository contains Unreal 5.4+ curve editor filters and a heavily-modified MetaHuman character picker that works for both Metahuman and UE5-Mannequin-based control rigs.

Announcement/Walkthrough Video: COMING SOON

## License

See LICENSE.txt for more license info, but all portions of the picker that came from Epic's Metahuman picker are the sole property of Epic Games and licensed as Unreal-only content by them (not me).  
My modifications are released via the BSD 3-clause license so that you can use this in the Unreal Editor (5.4+) for commercial and noncommercial projects.

## Background

I'm building and releasing these tools to make animating in Unreal easier and faster for everyone.  My motive is to share what I've learned and build a large YT and discord community dedicated to progressing animation in unreal (animations can be easily used all game engines).  If you like this tool, please head over to https://youtube.com/@threepeatgames and subscribe and check out the videos.
